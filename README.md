# <u>Exotic Sorting in Java</u>
### For the 2022 CS3 Sorting Competition
##### Authors: Tiernan Lindauer, Julianne Insall

### The Optimal Solution:

This repository contains multiple different approaches to beating `Arrays.ParallelSort()` on a sort of 1B items with non-negative 32 bit integers.

The submission provided is present in the `radix_sorting` folder, in which the most optimized version is in `radix_sort/SingularSortingAnalysis.java`.
It sorts these 1B items in ~2.6s on average.
This optimized approach was achieved through `radix_sorting/GridSearchSortingAnalysis.java` that tests every combination of threads and bits used within the specified ranges.

#### Prior Art:

This `radix_sorting` is based on the code from <https://github.com/sverrbb/parallel-radix-sort/blob/main/Main.java>, however significant improvements have been made.
The average time this code takes to execute is ~3.6s, while this code takes only ~2.6s for 1B items.
This significant improvement in time is due to the numerous method calls that have been reduced and whose functions have been placed in-line with the rest of the code.
Much of the member data of each class has also been reduced, and consigned to individual methods.
Beyond that, the grid-search algorithm is vital in optimizing the time, because it can determine the absolute minimum of time possible with this algorithm.

Additionally, the code has been thoroughly documented through the use of line comments and Javadoc. A file-writing system has also been put in place that saves data from each run, as well as many computed statistics.

#### Team Contributions:
Tiernan wrote the code for the different attempts to beating `Arrays.parallelSort()`, and optimized the multithread radix sort from the link mentioned above.
Julianne worked to research different sorting methods that could beat `Arrays.parallelSort()` and explain how they're

#### Project Architecture
Inside of the folder `radix_sorting` are the two analysis classes, which run the sorting themselves and analyze the performance of each sort.
A `Util` class also exists, which contains code that performs a definitive check on whether the array is sorted or not, functions to find the average/min/st. dev of a dataset, and a function to write the machine's statistics to a file.
Inside of `radix_sorting` is `radix_sorting/data` and `radix_sorting/depricated`.
`radix_sorting/data` contains logs of trials, and is divided into further sub-folders of when they were run and on what machine
The depricated folder simply contains old code that is no longer used.


### Other Attempts:

The `counting_sort/ParallelizedCountingSort.java` class, whose implementation is hidden in `counting_sort/Sort.java`, does beat ParallelSort however only on smaller arrays, it runs out of memory

A parallel rank sort, which yielded good times as well (comprable to `Arrays.parallelSort()`) is present in the `rank_sort` folder.

A multi-pivot quicksort is present in the `multi_pivot_quicksort` folder

Additionally, a recursive quicksort as attempted in `recursive_quicksort`

Many of these approaches were tried in C++, and some in C, however the difficulty of multi-threading in these languages make fast sorts difficult, but potentially faster than comprable ones in Java.
